#ViBE (Visual Basic Economy)

ViBE or the Visual Basic Economy program is the client design to aid the transactions of the NEXUS Minecraft Server's virtual currency, the Pecunia. 

ViBE also includes the ServerCommand class, which is usable with the ViBE Server, and with SmokeSignal Servers, but you'll need to change the port.
